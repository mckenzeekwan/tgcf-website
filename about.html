      Eight hundred years ago, Xie Lian was the Crown Prince of the Xian Le
      kingdom. He was loved by his citizens and was considered the darling of
      the world. He

      to the Heavens at a young age; however, due to unfortunate circumstances,
      was quickly banished back to the mortal realm. Years later, he ascends
      again only to be banished again a few minutes after his ascension.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, eight hundred years later, Xie Lian ascends to the Heavens for the
      third time as the laughing stock among all three realms. On his first task
      as a god thrice ascended, he meets a mysterious ghost who rules the ghosts
      and terrifies the Heavens, yet, unbeknownst to Xie Lian, this ghost king
      has been paying attention to him for a very, very long time.

    <h2>The Four Famous Tales</h2>
    <p>
      The Four Famous Tales (四名景, Sì Míng Jǐng) were highly praised anecdote
      stories of the time before the four Heavenly Officials from the Heavenly
      Court ascended - "The Young Lord Who Poured Wine", "The Crown Prince Who
      Pleased the Gods", "The General Who Broke His Sword", and "The Princess
      Who Slit Her Throat"
    </p>
    <p>
      How the four tales came about was not particularly due to which officials
      had more power, but rather which one of their tales was more profound,
      spread the furthest amongst mortals who shared them with enthusiasm.

      He was widely known throughout the Xianle nation as the beloved yet
      strange prince. Never showing interest in what was considered normal for a
      prince, he simply declared, "I want to save the common people!". Through
      practice, hard work, and insight beyond his years, he perfected his
      cultivation and ascended to the Heavens at the age of 17.[1]
    </p>

    <p>
      After multiple unfortunate events, he was twice banished from the Heavens.
      800 years later, he ascended for the third time.[1]
