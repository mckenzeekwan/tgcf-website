      Eight hundred years ago, Xie Lian was the Crown Prince of the Xian Le
      kingdom. He was loved by his citizens and was considered the darling of
      the world. He ascended to the Heavens at a young age; however, due to
      unfortunate circumstances, was quickly banished back to the mortal realm.
      Years later, he ascends again only to be banished again a few minutes
      after his ascension.

    <p>
      Now, eight hundred years later, Xie Lian ascends to the Heavens for the
      third time as the laughing stock among all three realms. On his first task
      as a god thrice ascended, he meets a mysterious ghost who rules the ghosts
      and terrifies the Heavens, yet, unbeknownst to Xie Lian, this ghost king
      has been paying attention to him for a very, very long time.
